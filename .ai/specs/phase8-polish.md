# Phase 8: Polish

## Goal
Project is presentable and documented.

## Deliverables
- README: architecture, screenshots, usage, build instructions
- docs/npu-design.md: instruction rationale, what each accelerates
- docs/isa-reference.md: complete quick reference (should already exist, verify/update)
- TUI: NPU status panel, instruction statistics
- Code cleanup: consistent formatting, complete docstrings, no dead code
- Performance profile: where is time spent, what would hardware accelerate
